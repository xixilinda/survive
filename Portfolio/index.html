            <p>Survive is an educational website that allows users to learn how to deal with dangerous offences 
                and emergencies by providing several series of text-based game. Users can know about different 
                offence rates in different rigions and can choose the game in these regions to play game with the 
                specific stories based on relatively high crime rates  in this city.</p>
            <p>Besides, users can also view and search different kind of services on the such as police stations 
                and hospital. Most of them are presented with address  and telephone numbers. This is to allow users 
                to get familiar with the place they are living in and know what kind of services are available nearby.</p>

            <div class="view-part">
                <h3>Product Requirement</h3>
                <p>1. Implement an web-application.</p>
                <p>2. Use one or more datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.au/">State Library of Queensland (SLQ). </a>, and utilise them to develope the concept</p>
                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>1. Discussion with teammates on zoom and give some tips and ideas on ideation.</p>
                <p>2. Finding appropriate datasets.</p>
                <p>3. As a presenter in presentation.</p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>1. Sometime we think the Datasets are very useful. however, some datasets are small or lack of API. So, 
                    choosing datasets is very important.</p>
                <p>2. At the first time, our team fail to design websites with interaction to datasets. We just use it as background, 
                    but interaction with datasets is more meaningful for the websites because we can find some problem or creative 
                    solution from using datasets.</p>
                <p>3 As for the team discussion, about interaction of our wbsite, we have discussed a lot about it, 
                    but when we retalked about our website, our work and thoughts were different. The logics were different 
                    base on same Idea. We think we should talk ideas more with teammates to make consensus.</p> 
                <p>4 Finally, after the presentation, my team had a deep discussion about the idea and modified a concept successfully.</p>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>Producing an crime story game based on crime rates background for the teenagers was our initial idea.The target audience 
                    of our website is 18-22 years old college freshmen who have left or are about to go to a new city to study. 
                    For such students and their families, safety always comes first. However, the feedback from course coordinator, tutors and other 
                    teams showed that we should not just make datasets as background. Besides, we should consider the goal of our 
                    application whether teach teenagers to protect themselves from crimes or teach them about types of crime. we 
                    realized the existing and potential problems of our ideas, so we made some changes according to that.</p>
                <p>According to the suggestion that bring the data into the central part of the game rather than being a background, 
                    we changed the main datasets to police stations, hospital and ambulance, and the offence data will be displayed 
                    as an introduction and reminder after the game. In this case, the location of police stations, hospitals and ambulances 
                    could be used in the game as a key interaction element. Wrong answer explanations in the game will be available as 
                    one of the feedback mentioned. Besides, the style of our website was decided as hand-drawn and cartoon style thanks 
                    to the advice about sensitivity, the game and the pictures will not be too violent and scary</p>
                <p>What's more, We thought the situations of one tyle of crime may be different and complex. 
                    Thus, we decided to use map to let users to know their situations in game about where was policestations to help users to make decisions.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>We were hand to find similar websites like us. A lot of websites just give some tips about protecting from crimes and are little boring. 
                    We thought the story game will make learning protecting from crimes more efficient.
                </p>

            <div class="view-part">
                <h3>Product Requirement</h3>
                <p>1. Producing paper prototypes</p>
                <p>2. Updating Prototypes</p>
                <p>3. Starting to implement websites</p>
                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>1. Designing the paper prototypes</p>
                <p>2. Discussing with teammates about websites's implement</p>
                <p>3. Designing the aesthetic prototypes</p>
                <p>4. Starting drawing the illustration of crime stories</p>
                <p>5.Joining websites implementation</p>
                <h3>6. Reflection</h3>
                <p>1. After prototype user test, a lot of users complained that our homepage was complex for then to understand. 
                    And the colors of websites were not obvious. The choices on map were hard to notice and chooce. I think the user test and prototype are useful for us to modification</p>
                <p>2. When starting to implement wensites, We find some proplems about API in some datasets. We should change to use other 
                    similar datasets. I learned that when using the datasets to concept ideas, we should check the details of datasets.</p>
                <p>3. Because of datasets limitations, we could not to find exact regions with high crime rates in one city. We made decision to 
                    design stories based on top 5 crime type rates relatively compared to other cities in Brisbane. The locations to choose were 
                    randomly and it also was good for users to not develope a awareness that some areas were bad. </p>
                <p>4. Considering the workload, We discussed to choose five cities to design stories.</p>

                <h3>Final Requirement</h3>
                <p>1. Websites implement </p>
                <p>2. Dealing with websites technologies </p>
                <p>3. Preparing for Trade Show </p>
                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>1. Game stories braimstromings</p>
                <p>2. Game illustrations drawing and design</p>
                <p>3. Making poster for Tradeshow</p>
                <p>4. helping to write report</p>
                <h3>Trade Show Result</h3>
                <p>Because of Covid 19, we took the course online and presented our websites on zoom in Trade Show. The Trade Show ended successfully.
                    When students and teachers listened our presentation and used our websites, they had positive experience because our websites were
                    worthwile and meaningful for teeangers to learn to face crimes. One teacher adviced that we could filter the information of hosipital, police stations 
                    ambulance stations. We thought it could be a good advice. And when I introduced that the map on game helped users to know the game's situatuion 
                    and the location chosen randomly to avoid people have bad awareness of one location, they acknowledged it and appreciated our intensions.  </p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>1. When implementing the websites, I was not good at typing codes. Fortunately, with help of my teammates, I learn a lot of codes.
                     However, my teammates comtributed a lot in typing code. So I take responsibilities to design our websites. I thoughr team cooperation was very important </p>
                <p>2. I thought it could be more fun and appealing to teenagers if the websites showed story illuatration with vivid animations.
                    However, these skills and technologies should be futher learned in the future.
                </p>
                <p>3. Our websites implement and trade show were successfull at end. We got a lot of questions and acknowledges about our websites. 
                    The Websites were well designed and constructed </p>

                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>The webpage is divided into two parts: importing the database api and storyline. We use PHP to import the stories, choices 
                    and endings stored in MySQL. Datasets and map informations are loaded by Javascript through API provided by government 
                    official site.

            <h3>Course Reflection</h3>
            <p>As for the course, I learned a lot from designing skills and technology skills. For example, I learned to transfer the concept to 
                the product. During the whole process, I should learn to cooperate with teammates and make consensus. We should draw sketch to 
                express idea directly and organize the logics of project. In our websites, I learn to design websites’ layout, structure, 
                and aesthetics, which improved my design skills. Besides, when we tested our prototypes with users, they could point out problems 
                that we have ignored. As a user when I took part in other teams’ user test. I found many problems and reminded me that I should 
                consider the user’s experience in websites. I was helped by my teammates and tutors a lot for technological problems, my coding 
                ability has improved a lot.</p>

            <p>As for teamwork and project, I learned to improve my communication skills in zoom. The main challenge is that my teammates and 
                I have never chatted face to face, and we should try hard to organize the schedule to discuss. What’s more, when I thought we 
                had made consensus, we found our thoughts to the project were different again. To overcome these challenges, We communicated more 
                in our spare time to make consensus. </p>
